🏥# Prescripto: Full-Stack Doctor Appointment Booking System

🌟##  Project Overview

Prescripto is a complete, scalable full-stack application for managing doctor appointments, built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It features distinct portals for Patients, Doctors, and an Admin, ensuring comprehensive management of the healthcare ecosystem.

This project was developed by following the comprehensive tutorial series by the GreatStack YouTube channel, and has been successfully deployed using Render.

Appointment Booking: Select a doctor, choose an available date/time slot, and book an appointment.

Profile Management: Register, login, update personal information, and track all past and upcoming appointments.
